      <p>
         Hundru Falls, located about 45 kilometers from Ranchi, is one of Jharkhand's most famous and spectacular natural attractions. 
         Formed by the Subarnarekha River as it plunges dramatically from a height of 98 meters (320 feet) off the edge of the 
         Chota Nagpur Plateau, it ranks as the 34th highest waterfall in India.
      </p>
      <p>
        The waterfall is a popular destination for both peaceful picnics and adventure activities. Visitors can enjoy the natural beauty 
        from various viewpoints or make the challenging descent of approximately 750 steps to the base of the falls, where a natural pool
         offers a place for bathing and relaxation. The area also attracts trekking enthusiasts, and for those seeking an extra thrill, 
         a zip-line facility provides a unique, bird's-eye view across the cascading water.
